The power card viewer application is an app for browsing and viewing information for 
DnD 4th edition power cards.

This application is *heavily* inspired by the fabulous fan made content for printable 
power cards.  The primary difference is that this application won't make little baby 
bunnies cry for printing pages and pages of power cards.
